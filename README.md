| `src/playbookgen/` | Python files for generating playbooks using LLM.                                                                                       |


## PlaybookGen CLI Tool

The `playbookgen` CLI tool is used for generating playbooks using the LLM model. The tool is located in the `src/playbookgen/` folder.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```
3. Create and activate venv, and install the package in development mode:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Usage

To run the PlaybookGen CLI tool:

```bash
cd src/playbookgen
python main.py
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter `ImportError: cannot import name 'OpenAI' from 'openai'`, you may need to reinstall the OpenAI package:

```bash
pip uninstall openai
pip install openai
```
